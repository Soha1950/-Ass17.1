Based on the graph, we can see that the average age of customers, whether they have subscribed to a fixed deposit or not, is approximately between 38 and 40 years. The significant overlap in the boxplots for both groups suggests that age is not a strong predictor of whether a customer will subscribe to a fixed deposit.

This type of graph is very useful for comparing the distribution of a variable, such as age, among different groups, such as target groups. However, FacetGrid is most effective for visualizing age distributions in the 20-30 year range and for ages 60 and older.

The graph above shows that the duration of the last contact with the customer is a useful predictor of the target variable. In fact, the longer the contact duration, the more likely the response is positive. This is consistent with the data overview, which indicates that this field strongly affects the target variable and should only be used for benchmarking purposes.

The graph above indicates that customers with admin jobs have the highest rates of both term deposit subscriptions and non-subscriptions. This is simply because there are more clients in admin roles than in any other profession.

The majority of the customers are married.

The chart above illustrates the bank's call rate and customer response rate for each month, with the trend lines moving in different directions. This can be interpreted in two ways: either the bank increases its calls when demand for deposits declines, or the timing of the calls is suboptimal. The highest call rates occurred in May and August, while the highest subscription rates were in March and September.

It's apparent that certain numerical features display notable correlations. For instance, "nr.employed" and "euribor3m" exhibit a correlation coefficient of 0.95, while "euribor3m" and "emp.var.rate" show a correlation of 0.97. These correlations stand out as exceptionally high when compared to others observed in the heatmap.
